# PSoXide demo disc.

# `make disc` builds the chain-load blob, the launcher, every program, and lays
# them out into the PSoXide game library as one disc. `make check` runs the
# host tests.
#
# Not yet wired up: Cortex Ignition (needs the editor cook) and Half-Life
# (needs the Half-Life game data and a full asset cook). See PLAN.md.
